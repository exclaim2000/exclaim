I haven't been thinking of drinking lately. That feels good. I've either been too wrapped up in work, or occupied with other areas in my life. I think part, if not all, of my brain needs to adjust to this change however. Something isn't right. I am still getting snappy and not keeping my cool. I understand that alcohol and drinking changes the physiology of your brain if you expose it to enough drinking habits for a prolonged period of time.

But is it the drug, or is it the habit. I don't know. I need to try and change that thinking of anger and short fuse to more calm and hear things out instead of the knee jerk reaction I have now. I wonder if that will form a better habit for myself and others around me. We'll see. I'll keep this blog going. If I hit 50 posts, I'll buy a domain. That's my goal.
