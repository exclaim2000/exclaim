I Failed. Second day inâ€¦. and now the third day in. It has been rough and I just wanted to take my mind off things. Well that's what I'm doing now. I should mention I caved quite easily last night when I met up with my old coworkers. Just two beers. I felt fine in the morning, maybe could of done with more sleep. 

But as I type up this post now, I'm having a beer. It's been a rough day today and I am in no mood to do anything but drink. I keep coming here. I know it. I want it though. I need to just turn my brain off. I need to silence the stress I had. Which is like just ignoring the root cause of what is causing the stress agreed. But we are short term satisfaction driven beings. We need these fixes in order to keep going. Sucks. But here I am.

I'm drinking. I'm doing the exact thing I set this blog up to prevent. I didn't say this was going to be just the roses. Just the reality.
