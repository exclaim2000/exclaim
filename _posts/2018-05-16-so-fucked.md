So fucked. I am messed up. I was perpetually hung over and drunk since last Thursday. Now I'm back. I had to go to work 6 times out of the 20 since I've started my new job. The new job that I promised myself that I wouldn't drink and have a smash at. The one I promised myself I wouldn't let myself down. The one that I promised I would have no regrets. I'm at the peak of my career thus far and I don't know how I got here with the level of disappointment I've let myself grow to.

So what am I going to do about it. Well I'm going to stop. I told my girlfriend that I need help. I want to go a month without it. That is just cover. I know that I am an alcoholic. I know that deep down. It's why I keep coming back to this point in my life. The month is a cover so I can use it as an excuse to say "I really like this no alcohol thing, I think I'll keep it up". Instead of telling her that I am an alcoholic and that I have deep problems.

Let's see how this month goes.
