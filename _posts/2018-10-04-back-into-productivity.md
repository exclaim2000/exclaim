I went out to dinner last night and avoided the peer pressure of a celebratory wine. I don't know where people get this ability to put the pressure on. But they really look at you weird when you don't want to drink alcohol. All the books i've been reading really indicate that it's rather the person putting the pressure on you that feels isolated and threatened by your choice. They know they're "indulging", but when you reject the norm and decide not to, they get uncomfortable. Doesn't matter, my life, my choice. I think if I lose friends this way, of not drinking, then so be it.

Yesterday I fixed up some work that had broken. Some changes to a service I was using and people follow. So I hope I helped them out from just an hours work. But I am happy I could fix that up. This morning I also kicked off an old project. I am going to rewrite it in a new language so I can ramp back up on skills for the new job.

Oh yeah. I signed up to a new job. It's in an industry that I've really passionate about. The team is truly amazing, passionate and excited to have me on board. I am very excited that I could join. They really pulled out all the stops to get me to sign on. Which is a great sign.

Anyhow. I am continuing to read the soberista's book. I am looking forward to finishing it. Not because it's a bad read. But because there is a follow up book from it that is more of a practical guide to kicking the drink after 6 weeks. Let's see. I can't remember the last 6 month gap I had in drinking.

Yay.
