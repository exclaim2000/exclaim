The stress is getting to me. I'm not coping well. I'm blowing up at the littlest of things and it is killing me. I'm not sure why I have such a short fuse but I do. Not great. Not good. 

I tried fixing a tire on my bike. It wasn't working. Tire levers were breaking and snapping and the tire just wasn't inflating. I couldn't handle it. I ended up handing it into the bike shop to deal with. 

Argh. Make me better.
