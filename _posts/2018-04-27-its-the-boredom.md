title: It's the boredom 
layout: post

It most clearly is. I can't operate with this brain of mine. It operates at a frequency that is painful. It can't stop. It can't slow. It needs to be occupied or forecibly slowed. If I just sit alone, or have no agenda I get antsy. I get bored, tired of myself. Tired of listening to podcasts, of reading, or reading news or scrolling the infinite scroll of social media. It's tiring and its because of boredom.

I just know this is the front door to revisiting this same trap. The cycle and the loop of going down the rabbit hole. I don't have much patience for others. It's a continuous let down by others. It is a continuous hurt. People don't keep their words. People think about themselves primarily. They have their own agenda's and don't think about the impact of their actions. I mean, look at how this world is looking. It's all about immediate and self priorities.

I need to figure out what to do with my time. I need to convince myself that simply just existing without an immediate purpose is okay. Maybe that will get me over the boredom hump. Maybe I can spin my brain down if I give it that freedom. I'll give it a try, because now as I sit home along whilst arguing with my partner over trivial bullshit, all I want to do is be alone and drink.
