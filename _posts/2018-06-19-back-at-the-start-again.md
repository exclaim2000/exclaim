Yah I’m back where I didn’t want to be. I got trashed every day this weekend. I suffered big time and my girlfriend saw it. She saw right through this bullshit this time. No getting around it. I was having massive anxiety attacks from my drinking and I couldn’t hide it. I was freaking out! No good. 

So we talked more about it. I have to stop. She thinks I can just cut down and limit myself. But I know I cannot. This is only going to work if I just stop. Full on stop. Cold turkey. I am really scared about my health now. The impact must be there. Outside of the relationships and missed opportunities. The physical impact must be there. I just need to wait for it to catch up with me.

I wonder if she has plans to leave me. Kind of a sad thing to think about. But what am I doing for her to want to stay around. She loves me. But how can you love the dr Hyde that is lurking in the shadows. You would far that person from coming out again no? I am scaring myself I need to say. Gross.

Alcohol sucks. I wish I live in a dry state.
