I'm back. And I'm not proud of it. I haven't written a posr since June. Meanwhile I quit my job after only 4 months. The pressure was not good. The fit was terrible and it hurt like hell to stay at that job. I realize I knew what I was in for from the beginning. I should of listened to myself and not ignored the warning signs. But it is done. But I am back here.

My drinking is off the hook. I have my girlfriend's friends around and even then I seem not to be able to keep a lid on this shit. I don't know. I'm back here.

I have a new job lined up, that I am very thrilled about. I think I would be even more thrilled if I wasn't so hungover all the time. I think this dependence really robs the brain of happy juice. The highs aren't as high in life anymore. I can't cope. 

I am pledging though. This new job. I won't fuck it up. I won't fuck my performance up, my true ability. I need to achieve and grow from others and let them grow from me too. I am tired of being a useless resource and a let down to others that care about me. Time to make a difference no?

Let's do it. No drinking. Putting the bottle in the bin. I pledge to myself this is the end chapter of this. I will track my progress, but the aim of this blog is that it becomes redundant. But still, seems like it is a valuable resource for me to lean on.

No. More.
