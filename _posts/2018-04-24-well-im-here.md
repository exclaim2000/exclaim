I have been here a while. I mean forward and backward from this position. This position of not knowing what is going to happen to me. See I keep slipping into this darkness. I am addicted. As hard as that as for me to write. I don’t know if it is conditioning of marketing, of social pressures. Or I don’t know if it is genetics. I don’t know if it is a habit that has formed due to my environment. All I know if that I keep finding myself in this position and it sucks.

I am not. Entirely sure what I will do with this blog. It will most likely just form a bunch of ramblings. I’m one week in, with a few days in change. I don’t have grand plans here. My plans first and foremost are not to drink anymore. It has gotten me nowhere. I am finally somewhere. I don’t know how but I’ve just landed a job I never thought I would get, now its up to me to make it a job I never thought I would keep. It’s a massive opportunity at present and the logic of which has left me with an overpowering ability to leave the bottles in the fridge. 

I’ve been reading books on this. Countless first hand accounts of the subject. Guides and meditations. But none have really helped. I don’t know if this job is the catalyst or just that I am so utterly tired of me spiraling down to nowhere. Alas here I am. Will this blog be my crutch? Or maybe just a distraction from the boredom that usually leaves me relapsing. Who knows. Maybe it will help you along the way? That’s not my goal but oddly enough it is something productive that I previously would always put off to another time.

Cya soon.
