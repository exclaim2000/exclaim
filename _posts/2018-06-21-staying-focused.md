The challenge for me now is not blowing up. Everything seems to be getting under my skin. I've got a new job and I am struggling to comprehend and store everything into my brain that needs to be. I continuously feel like I'm letting my boss down, though I think that may be his personality of crazy high expectations and lack of patience. Maybe, maybe not.

I am just going from zero to almost breakdown and the toll is adding up. Though I do see progress. This will be my 4th day without a drink, and boy was it a perpetual drinking session. 4 straight days of hard intense drinking at the point where by Sunday night I needed to be consoled as I was having an anxiety attack. Not pretty when the person that was consoling you is your partner. Exposed, vulnerable and scared I would of lost her. I surrendered. No more drinking and it was a commitment I made to her. Which seems like the bond to those words is stronger than the promise I had made to myself in the past about quitting.

I think I would love to hit a year again of no drinking. I want to get back in shape, productive and passionate again. I miss those times. The times where I felt I was in control of my life and that my life actually had a trajectory that wasn't to the bottleshopâ€¦.
