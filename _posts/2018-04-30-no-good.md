I relapsed. Hard. I went camping with my girlfriend. There was a tipping point where I chose to drink one beer over lunch. That turned into another beer, which subsequently ended with us buying wine, a 6 pack and another tall beer. Lets just say there was not much left over the next morning. I feel sick, dissapointed in myself and this really feels like I have no control.

I was going so well too. I was reading this naked mind, which trys to deal with changing the subconcious thoughts so that the urge is gone. I honetsly felt like this was happening. I mean I say that because when both of us walked into a super market earlier that day she asked me "Do you want any beer or wine for us to drink tonight?". I declined. Previously that would of been an invitation to just go all out. But I honestly didn't want it.

May the 1st today. It starts now. I hope this is the last relapse story on this blog.
